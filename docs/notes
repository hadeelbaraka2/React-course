## Project Overview
This is a simple React application created as part of my React course (Level 1).
The goal of this assignment is to containerize the project using Docker and publish it to GitHub with clear instructions.

## Docker Steps Summary
1. Created a `Dockerfile` to build the React app.
2. Built the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t react-course .
   ```
3. run the docker container :
     ```bash
     docker run -p 3000:3000 react-course
     ```
4. open the app in browser :
    http://localhost:3000   


## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Docker Challenge
The main Docker issue I faced was an authentication error when pulling the base image (node:18) from Docker Hub.
This was resolved by verifying my Docker Hub email and re-running the build command.

### Git/GitHub Lesson
The most important lesson I learned was the importance of clear commit messages and organizing the repository
structure properly so that any developer can understand and run the project easily.     

## Deployment Notes

- The project was deployed to a production environment using Back4App Containers.
- Docker was used to build and run the application inside a Node.js (node:18) container.
- During deployment, the application exposed port 3000 and installed dependencies using npm.
- A temporary production URL was generated and used to verify that the application is running successfully.
